# MTH440 - Computational Number Theory
## Winter 2021 - Oregon State University
### Final Grade: A
This is my coursework from MTH440. The homework consisted of 5 bi-weekly assignments, written in LaTeX. A number of assignments include Sage code, which is embedded within the TeX documents. Only HW5 contains the Jupyter notebook used to carry out the computations.
